The ”IrLumDB App” is an ML-based service integrated with the experimental database to predict luminescence wavelength (λlum) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes requiring only molecular formula of the ligands as a feature.

Visit our app <https://irlumdb.streamlit.app/>.
